# This is a Calendar application with the ability to add tasks. Basic functionality.

1. Display the days of the month
2. Month displays
3. Year displays.
4. Add tasks
5. Remove tasks
6. Check tasks
7. Edit tasks

The ability to switch between them is also implemented, which means that in calendar mode we can use the left or right arrows to switch the month.

Clicking on the current date will take you to months mode and allow you to switch between years. 

By clicking again, you can switch between decades.

In the tab with the days of the calendar month, when you click on the number, a modal window appears in which you can add, delete, change the status and edit tasks. When switching to any other date, these tasks are saved
